and practical requirements of validating radar-rainfall maps and new radar technologies. We discuss a framework for reflectivity
based rainfall estimation, including estimation of uncertainty of radar-rainfall estimates. Validation of radar-rainfall products is a
major challenge for broad utilization of these products in hydrologic applications. In the discussion of radar-rainfall prediction we
focus on orographically induced extreme rainfall and flooding, discuss the issues of detection, statistical sample size, and scale effects.

across far-flung topical journals, government publications, and club newsletters. As part of an inter-institutional project to globalize karst information ({KIP}, the Karst
Information Portal), the {USF} Library undertook a structured battery of literature searches to map the domain of karst literature. The study used 4,300 individual searches and four literature databases: {GeoRef}, {BIOSIS}, Anthropology Plus, and {GPO} Access. The searches were based on a list of 632 terms including 321 karst-related keywords culled from three leading encyclopedias and glossaries of cave and karst science. An examination of yearly changes in publication rate indicates that for the last 45 years, the number of cave and karst publications has increased steadily, as has the number of journals in which they appear. In particular, the past ten years cover a period of rapid growth where karst-specific journals achieved peer-review status, and individual journals accepted more cave and karst papers for publication.},

	abstract = {Coastal karstic aquifers are affected by the tides, primarily due to pressure variations moving inland via tunnels or conduits. This behavior is clearly demonstrated by recent measurements made in the Woodville Karst Plain near Wakulla Springs. The decay rate, λ, and phase speed, V, of these waves are determined by statistical analysis of observations of water levels (made every 5 minutes) over a period of 144 days at two locations 16.6 km apart: one at the coast close to Spring Creek Springs and one at a borehole that connects to a karst tunnel close to Wakulla Spring. The calculated values are λ = 7.87 x 10–5 m–1 and V = 2.0 m s–1 for diurnal tidal modes and λ = 9.25 x 10–5 m–1 and V = 4.4 m s–1 for semi-diurnal tidal modes. These decay rates are equivalent to e-folding scales of 12.7 and 10.8 km, respectively. The decay rate is smaller and the phase speed is larger than predicted for a Darcian aquifer by factors of roughly 100, illustrating the profound influence that a conduit can have on aquifer dynamics.

	abstract = {Groundwater tracing and cave mapping conducted in the Woodville Karst Plain of north Florida have revealed an extensive dendritic network of saturated conduits, more than 70 km in total length, that convey water to Wakulla Spring from the northeast, north, northwest, and south. In some places, the conduits are known to connect to swallets and in others are known to extend up-gradient into the aquifer matrix. Two sets of tracer tests were performed in 2005 and 2006 to map groundwater flow pathways between the Ames Sink group of swallets, which receive approximately 60\% of the City of Tallahassee’s storm water runoff, and the City’s wastewater spray field, and characterize groundwater velocities along those pathways. The results of these tests revealed that water flows rapidly from both locations to Wakulla Spring. Groundwater velocities through the swimmable portion of the conduit network range from {\textasciitilde}1500 to {\textgreater}2000 m/day and velocities through the smaller conduit pathways range from 250 to {\textgreater}800 m/day.

We have also compared the shape and timing of the tracer concentration recovery curves to groundwater levels and swallet stage during the tested periods. The results indicate that the aquifer is composed of conduits with varying capacities to convey water and that those capacities establish controls on local hydraulic gradients in the aquifer. More broadly, the results of these tracer studies indicate that tracer recovery curves can reveal significant and potentially quantifiable insights about the hydraulic dynamics of the aquifer when interpreted relative to continuously measured hydraulic data such as heads and flows within the region being tested.},

	abstract = {Spring Creek Springs and Wakulla Springs are large first magnitude springs that derive water from the Upper Floridan Aquifer.
The submarine Spring Creek Springs are located in a marine estuary and Wakulla Springs are located 18 km inland. Wakulla Springs
has had a consistent increase in flow from the 1930s to the present. This increase is probably due to the rising sea level, which
puts additional pressure head on the submarine Spring Creek Springs, reducing its fresh water flow and increasing flows in Wakulla
Springs. To improve understanding of the complex relations between these springs, flow and salinity data were collected from June
25, 2007 to June 30, 2010. The flow in Spring Creek Springs was most sensitive to rainfall and salt water intrusion, and the flow
in Wakulla Springs was most sensitive to rainfall and the flow in Spring Creek Springs. Flows from the springs were found to be
connected, and composed of three repeating phases in a karst spring flow cycle: Phase 1 occurred during low rainfall periods and
was characterized by salt water backflow into the Spring Creek Springs caves. The higher density salt water blocked fresh water
flow and resulted in a higher equivalent fresh water head in Spring Creek Springs than in Wakulla Springs. The blocked fresh water
was diverted to Wakulla Springs, approximately doubling its flow. Phase 2 occurred when heavy rainfall resulted in temporarily high
creek flows to nearby sinkholes that purged the salt water from the Spring Creek Springs caves. Phase 3 occurred after streams
returned to base flow. The Spring Creek Springs caves retained a lower equivalent fresh water head than Wakulla Springs, causing
them to flow large amounts of fresh water while Wakulla Springs flow was reduced by about half.},

@report{lane_spring_2001,
	location = {Tallahassee, Fl},
	title = {The Spring Creek submarine springs group, Wakulla county, Florida},
	abstract = {Submarine springs are offshore discharges of groundwater. In Florida they are associated with coastal
karst areas. Submarine karst springs and sinkholes on the Florida Platform constitute integral parts of
Florida's hydrogeological regime. They are some of the ultimate down-gradient discharge points for fresh
water from Florida's aquifers. Knowledge of their location, hydrology, and stratigraphy will add to an understanding
of the overall structure and extent of Florida's aquifer systems. Conceivably, they may represent
supplementary sources for fresh water supplies. In addition, they are micro-environments for fish nurseries;
manatees use some of them; and some are known archaeological sites. They are key elements in
the linked Earth systems among Florida's environments and ecosystems: the uplands, the coasts, and the
continental shelf marine realms.

The Florida Geological Survey is gathering information on these karst features as part of ongoing Florida
coastal research programs. This report documents the results of the first investigation, on the Spring Creek
Springs Group, Wakulla County, Florida.

The Spring Creek Springs Group is comprised of at least 13 submarine springs situated in the mouth of
Spring Creek and adjacent Stuart Cove, along the Gulf of Mexico coastline in Wakulla County, Florida.
Combined flow of the group is about 2,000 cubic feet per second. The springs are fed by conduits, likely
developed along fractures in the underlying carbonates. Analysis of local fracture trends suggests that
one surface water source for the spring flow is Lost Creek, a stream captured by a sinkhole about six miles
northwest of the springs. Regional groundwater of the Floridan aquifer system also supplies a portion of
the total spring flow. Seismic surveys and depth-recorder profiles were conducted across 12 of the
springs. The springs’ cross-sectional profiles show them to be cone-shaped sinks, typical of springs developed
in Florida karst. Water chemisty data collected at nine of the springs showed variation suggestive
of mixing and possibly differing surface and ground-water sources for the springs. All the springs exhibit
pulsating flow, alternating surges of boiling surface turbulence caused by rapidly upwelling water, followed
by relatively quiescent flow. This suggests that the complex conduit system supplying the springs may be
influenced by local recharge events and by tidal stage.},

	title = {Estimated withdrawals from principal aquifers in the United States, 2000},
	url = {http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/2005/1279/pdf/circ1279.pdf},
	abstract = {Fresh ground-water withdrawals from 66 principal aquifers in the United States were estimated for irrigation, public-supply, and self-supplied industrial water uses for the year 2000. Total ground-water withdrawals were 76,500 million gallons per day, or 85,800 thousand acre-feet per year for these three uses. Irrigation used the largest amount of ground water, 56,900 million gallons per day, followed by public supply with 16,000 million gallons per day, and self-supplied industrial with 3,570 million gallons per day. These three water uses represented 92 percent of the fresh ground-water withdrawals for all uses in the United States, the remaining 8 percent included self-supplied domestic, aquaculture, livestock, mining, and thermoelectric power uses.
Aquifer withdrawals were categorized by five
lithologic groups: unconsolidated and semiconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers, carbonate-rock aquifers, igneous and metamorphic-rock aquifers, sandstone aquifers, and sandstone and carbonate-rock aquifers. Withdrawals from aquifers that were not included in one of the 66 principal aquifers were reported in an “Other” aquifers group. The largest withdrawals in the United States were from unconsolidated and semiconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers, which accounted for 80 percent of total withdrawals from all aquifers. Carbonate-rock aquifers provided 8 percent of the withdrawals, and igneous and metamorphic-rock aquifers, 6 percent. Withdrawals from sandstone aquifers, from sandstone and carbonate-rock aquifers, and from the “Other” aquifers category each constituted about 2 percent of the total withdrawals reported.
Fifty-five percent of the total withdrawals for irrigation, public-supply, and self-supplied industrial water uses were provided by the High Plains aquifer, California Central Valley aquifer system, the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer, and the Basin and Range basin-fill aquifers. These aquifers provided most of the withdrawals for irrigation. The High Plains aquifer was the most intensively used aquifer in the United States. This aquifer provided 23 percent of the total withdrawals from all aquifers for irrigation, public-supply, and self-supplied industrial water uses combined, and 30 percent of the total withdrawals from all aquifers for irrigation.
The primary aquifers used for public supply were the glacial sand and gravel aquifers of the Northeastern and North-Central States, the California Coastal Basin aquifers, the Floridan aquifer system, the Basin and Range basin-fill aquifers, and the Coastal lowlands aquifer system along the Gulf Coast. These five aquifers provided 43 percent of the total withdrawals from all aquifers for public supply. The glacial sand and gravel aquifers, Coastal lowlands aquifer system,
Floridan aquifer system, and Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer system were the primary sources of water for self-supplied industrial use; these aquifers provided 46 percent of the total ground-water withdrawals for that use},

	abstract = {This report describes new digital maps delineating areas of the United States, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, having karst or the potential for development of karst and pseudokarst. These maps show areas underlain by soluble rocks and also by volcanic rocks, sedimentary deposits, and permafrost that have potential for karst or pseudokarst development. All 50 States contain rocks with potential for karst development, and about 18 percent of their area is underlain by soluble rocks having karst or the potential for development of karst features. The areas of soluble rocks shown are based primarily on selection from State geologic maps of rock units containing significant amounts of carbonate or evaporite minerals. Areas underlain by soluble rocks are further classified by general climate setting, degree of induration, and degree of exposure. Areas having potential for volcanic pseudokarst are those underlain chiefly by basaltic-flow rocks no older than Miocene in age. Areas with potential for pseudokarst features in sedimentary rocks are in relatively unconsolidated rocks from which pseudokarst features, such as piping caves, have been reported. Areas having potential for development of thermokarst features, mapped exclusively in Alaska, contain permafrost in relatively thick surficial deposits containing ground ice. This report includes a {GIS} database with links from the map unit polygons to online geologic unit descriptions.},
